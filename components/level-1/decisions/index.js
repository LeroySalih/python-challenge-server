                    <SectionText>
                    <p>A decision allows the program to execute different commands based on some data.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some examples of how to use decisions are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the temperature is greater than 30C,then turn on a fan.</li>
                            <li>If the water has reached a depth, then turn off the tap, else keep the tap on.</li>
                            <li>If the car is going greater than 100KM/H then turn on the alarm, else press the accelerator.</li>
                
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                        <p>To use the most simple decision in a program, we can use the <CodeInline>if</CodeInline> command.</p>
                        
                        <CodeExample 
                            code={`if condition:\n\trun_this_code`}
                            
                        />

                        <p>In the above code, if the condition is true, then the command <CodeInline>run_this_code()</CodeInline> will be executed.</p>
                        <p>In the example below, when the program detects a new player, the program will output a greeting.</p>
                        
                        <CodeExample 
                            code={`if player == "new":\n\tprint("Hello new player!")`}
                            
                        />

                        <p>This greeting will only run when the player is new.</p>
                        <p>Note that the commands that are executed when the condition is true are always indented to seperate them from the normal program.</p>

                        <p>An if then else decision has 2 possible paths that can be executed based on a condition.</p>

                        <p>When the program finds an IF-THEN-ELSE decision
                            <ul>
                                <li>If the condition is true, then</li>
                                <li>run the first commands</li>
                                <li>else</li>
                                <li>run the second commands</li>
